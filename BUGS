Battery information
===================

When the plugin does not display the right values or update, you
can help fixing the problem by providing the following information:

- The battery information from "lshal".
- Information from the HAL monitor:
  - Run "lshal -m" in a terminal.
  - Discharge the battery for a couple of minutes (or till the
    problem occurs).
  - Plugin / out the adapter.
  - Press Ctrl + C to end the monitoring.

Copy the information obtained from the steps above, put it in a
file and create a bug report (http://bugzilla.xfce.org) with
the file attached.
